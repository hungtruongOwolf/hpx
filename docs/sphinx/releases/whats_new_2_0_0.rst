============================
|hpx| V2.0.0 (TBD)
============================

|hpx| V2.0.0 is one of the largest releases in the project's history, touching
the language baseline, the execution model, the networking layer, the build
system, and observability tooling. Roughly 680 pull requests and 120 closed
issues went into this cycle since v1.11.0 (June 2025). The sections below
expand on each major theme.

Language and Standard Baseline
==============================

- C++20 is now the *minimum* required standard, up from C++17. V1.11.0 was
  the last release to support C++17 (:hpx-issue:`5497`).
- Minimum supported compiler versions were raised across the board; older
  GCC versions (e.g. pre-9.3, :hpx-issue:`6240`) are no longer supported.
- A large volume of obsolete ``#if``/feature-test guards that existed only to
  support pre-C++20 compilers were removed (:hpx-issue:`6941`), simplifying
  the codebase now that C++20 is guaranteed.

C++20 Modules
=============

The entire |hpx| module hierarchy - organized in dependency "levels" - was
migrated to native C++20 module support, tracked issue-by-issue
(:hpx-issue:`6014`), with no required changes for consumers.

C++26 Adoption (Ahead of Standardization)
=========================================

Adopted early via reflection and experimental compiler support:

|hpx| adopted several not-yet-finalized C++26 features early, using
experimental compiler support, well ahead of formal standardization:

- **Reflection-based serialization** - arbitrary user types can now be
  serialized without hand-written ``serialize()`` member functions, using
  compile-time reflection to enumerate members automatically.
- **Reflection-driven actions and components** - a large family of new
  reflection APIs replaced macro-heavy boilerplate:

  - ``reflect_action`` integrated with ``basic_action``
    (:hpx-pr:`7281`), including direct actions (:hpx-pr:`7349`),
    component actions (:hpx-pr:`7311`), and auto-registration
    (:hpx-pr:`7298`).
  - ``reflect_client`` and the ``HPX_REFLECT_CLIENT`` macro for
    reflection-based client types (:hpx-pr:`7385`), with
    ``hpx::launch::sync`` overload support (:hpx-pr:`7417`).
  - ``hpx::async<^^func>(target, ...)``-style reflection overloads
    (:hpx-pr:`7376`), plus reflection overloads threaded through
    ``async_distributed`` (sync, post, dataflow, async_continue,
    launch-policy variants: :hpx-pr:`7509`, :hpx-pr:`7515`,
    :hpx-pr:`7523`, :hpx-pr:`7462`).
  - Example programs migrated to demonstrate the new API:
    ``factorial_reflection`` (:hpx-pr:`7508`), ``fibonacci_reflection``
    (:hpx-pr:`7455`), and the ``spell_check`` examples migrated to
    ``HPX_ACTION`` (:hpx-pr:`7338`).
  - A migration guide (:hpx-pr:`7348`) and compile-time overhead
    benchmarks comparing macros vs. ``reflect_action``
    (:hpx-pr:`7332`, :hpx-pr:`7459`) were added to help users and
    maintainers evaluate the transition.

- **Early contract support** - |hpx| API functions have begun to be annotated
  with C++26 contract preconditions/postconditions, starting with sorting
  and heap algorithms (:hpx-pr:`7434`).

Senders/Receivers Overhaul
==========================

|hpx|'s original, home-grown implementation of P0443/P1897/P2300
(:hpx-issue:`5045`) has been removed entirely and replaced by |stdexec|_
(|nvidia|_'s reference implementation) as the sole senders/receivers
foundation, usable from both C++20 and C++26:

- Multiple correctness/compliance passes: fixing P2300 compliance and
  ``set_stopped`` handling for ``any_sender`` (:hpx-pr:`7453`),
  ``get_allocator`` query support for schedulers (:hpx-pr:`7320`),
  allocator support for ``when_all_vector`` (:hpx-pr:`7346`), and
  ``get_completion_domain`` advertisement on ``run_loop`` (:hpx-pr:`7276`).
- Distributed and accelerator adaptors were updated to integrate cleanly
  with |stdexec|_: ``async_mpi`` (:hpx-pr:`7341`, :hpx-pr:`7318`,
  :hpx-pr:`7277`), ``async_cuda`` (:hpx-pr:`7330`, :hpx-pr:`7374`), and the
  fork-join executor (fixing truncation bugs on large ranges,
  :hpx-issue:`6922`).
  Distributed sender/receiver facilities were also moved into their own
  module (:hpx-pr:`7396`) with dedicated distributed test coverage
  (:hpx-pr:`7402`, :hpx-pr:`7354`).
- Algorithm-level sender/receiver support was extended to more algorithms,
  e.g. ``set_intersection`` (:hpx-pr:`7365`), ``set_difference``
  (:hpx-pr:`7344`), and ``shift_left``/``shift_right`` (:hpx-pr:`7296`).
- Miscellaneous but important bug fixes: a lifetime race in
  ``sync_wait``'s notify path (:hpx-pr:`7394`), a silent hang in
  ``make_future`` with ``run_loop_scheduler`` (:hpx-pr:`7437`), and a
  future/promise bridge redesign (:hpx-pr:`7355`).

``tag_invoke`` Removal
======================

A systematic, multi-PR effort removed ``tag_invoke``-based customization
across nearly every layer of the library, replacing it with plain member
functions - this is one of the more consequential breaking changes for
downstream code that customized |hpx| behavior via ADL/``tag_invoke``:

- Core execution layer (:hpx-pr:`7368`), executor CPOs
  (:hpx-pr:`7319`), container algorithms (:hpx-pr:`7395`), and parallel
  algorithms broadly (:hpx-pr:`7380`, :hpx-pr:`7301`).
- Specific customization points converted to members, e.g.
  ``connect_t`` (:hpx-pr:`7292`).
- Cleanup of now-stale ``hpx_tag_invoke`` module dependencies
  (:hpx-pr:`7451`, :hpx-pr:`7452`) and a final sweep
  (:hpx-pr:`7443`).

Networking / Parcelport Work
============================

- A new, optimized MPI parcelport, with orderly teardown that quiesces
  before ``MPI_Finalize`` (:hpx-pr:`7404`).
- An optimized |lci|_ parcelport.
- Substantial AGAS/parcelset hardening:

  - ``force_disconnect`` support for removing crashed/unreachable
    localities, including races between disconnect completion and AGAS
    resolve visibility (:hpx-issue:`7483`, :hpx-pr:`7490`,
    :hpx-pr:`7491`, :hpx-pr:`7447`).
  - Dijkstra termination detection improvements, including probe retry
    bounding and cursor restart per probe (:hpx-pr:`7496`,
    :hpx-pr:`7516`, :hpx-pr:`7495`).
  - Connection/communicator caching fixes, e.g. avoiding communicator
    reuse between collectives/scan test phases (:hpx-pr:`7526`,
    :hpx-pr:`7364`) and caching channel communicators per site
    (:hpx-pr:`7481`).
  - Disconnected-locality handling, including a dedicated dispatch guard
    (:hpx-pr:`7536`, :hpx-pr:`7537`) and correct error handling in
    ``resolve_locality`` (:hpx-pr:`7388`).
  - A fix for the shared-pointer serialization type-confusion /
    deserialization vulnerability reported in :hpx-issue:`7333`
    (:hpx-pr:`7334`).

Observability / Tracing
=======================

- A new, minimal tracing abstraction layer, ``hpx::tracing``
  (:hpx-issue:`7049`), unifying the |ittnotify|_ (Intel VTune) and |tracy|_
  backends behind one API, with |apex|_ also unified under it (:hpx-pr:`7293`).
- |tracy|_ support was added as a first-class profiler backend, including
  causal tracing (:hpx-pr:`7423`), fiber support activation
  (:hpx-issue:`6989`), and per-subsystem event gating for overhead control
  (:hpx-pr:`7529`).
- Instrumentation was added broadly: schedulers and work-stealing
  (:hpx-pr:`7450`), background work and OS-thread sleep events
  (:hpx-pr:`7484`), parcel send/receive (:hpx-pr:`7511`), future
  continuations (:hpx-pr:`7403`), task lifecycle events
  (:hpx-pr:`7347`), suspend/resume hooks (:hpx-pr:`7372`), data-parallel
  workloads (:hpx-pr:`7392`), and general runtime instrumentation
  (:hpx-pr:`7357`).
- New tooling built on top of this infrastructure: **hpx-top**, an
  interactive TUI performance monitor (:hpx-issue:`7001`), and
  **hpx_stat_viewer**.
- A distributed-observability prototype ("HPX-Vision") was proposed and
  discussed (:hpx-issue:`7225`) as a longer-term direction beyond this
  release.


Collectives Infrastructure
==========================

Hierarchical collectives were built out and hardened substantially this
cycle:

- New hierarchical primitives: ``all_reduce`` (with the reduction seed now
  moved instead of copied, :hpx-pr:`7398`), ``all_gather``/``scatter``
  (flattened payloads, :hpx-pr:`7375`), ``all_to_all`` (flattened
  exchange payloads :hpx-pr:`7377`, hierarchical implementation
  :hpx-pr:`7307`, size-based pairwise dispatch :hpx-pr:`7430`/:hpx-pr:`7431`,
  and a ~66x performance regression fix for the flat variant,
  :hpx-issue:`7411`), and a hierarchical **scan** collective
  (:hpx-pr:`7343`).
- Validation and robustness hardening across collectives, including
  rejecting explicit generations mixed with auto-generation
  (:hpx-pr:`7369`), unifying generation handling across collective types
  (:hpx-pr:`7326`), and broad input-validation/tree-coverage hardening
  (:hpx-pr:`7321`, :hpx-pr:`7359`).
- ``hpx::distributed::barrier`` was reimplemented on top of the
  collectives infrastructure rather than its own ad hoc protocol
  (:hpx-issue:`7203`).

Supervision Module
==================

A new lifecycle/observability subsystem, "supervision," was introduced for
managing dispatch of distributed work under crash/partial-failure
conditions:

- Core infrastructure for lifecycle events and observers
  (:hpx-pr:`7399`), a dispatch component (:hpx-pr:`7413`), and
  admission control (:hpx-pr:`7409`).
- Fenced dispatch support (:hpx-pr:`7425`), dispatch locality and join
  epoch handling (:hpx-pr:`7438`), and target resolution
  (:hpx-pr:`7427`), plus general dispatch fixes and cleanup
  (:hpx-pr:`7457`).
- A reflection overload for ``dispatch_work`` was added consistent with
  the broader C++26 reflection push (:hpx-pr:`7432`).
- The module can be disabled at build time (``HPX_WITH_SUPERVISION=OFF``);
  a related abort-on-disable regression was fixed
  (:hpx-issue:`7513`).

Parallel Algorithms
===================

A large, ongoing wave of standard-conformance and correctness work across
the parallel algorithms library:

- **C++20/23 conformance**: fixing sentinel return-type mismatches in
  ``hpx::ranges`` container CPOs (:hpx-pr:`7322`), unifying projection
  support across ``starts_with``/``ends_with`` (:hpx-pr:`7314`),
  ``unique``/``unique_copy`` (:hpx-pr:`7381`), and
  ``min``/``max``/``minmax_element``/``is_heap`` (:hpx-pr:`7305`).
- **New algorithms**: ``hpx::experimental::for_each_index`` per P4150
  (:hpx-issue:`7214`), ``hpx::ranges::iota`` (:hpx-issue:`6969`),
  ``find_last``/``find_last_if``/``find_last_if_not``
  (:hpx-issue:`6892`), and missing C++23 range algorithms -
  ``fold``, ``chunk_by``, ``slide``, ``stride``, ``cartesian_product``
  (:hpx-issue:`6908`).
- **Correctness fixes**: ``max_element`` returning the last, rather than
  first, greatest element (:hpx-pr:`7304`), two bugs in ``chunk_size.hpp``
  involving swapped arguments (:hpx-issue:`6931`), an incorrect
  single-segment subrange handling bug in segmented ``scan``
  (:hpx-issue:`7052`), and non-preserved sequenced semantics in parallel
  ``uninitialized_relocate`` for overlapping ranges (:hpx-issue:`6878`).
- **Proxy/iterator support**: proxy support for ``find`` algorithms
  (:hpx-issue:`6719`), unwrapping contiguous iterators
  (:hpx-issue:`6729`), and conditional special member functions for
  ``zip_iterator`` (:hpx-issue:`6752`).
- **Datapar/SIMD**: fixing |eve|_/simd unaligned load/store broadcast bugs
  (:hpx-pr:`7435`, :hpx-issue:`7287`), and guarding a mismatched SIMD
  path on ``zip_iterator`` compatibility (:hpx-pr:`7328`).

Scheduler / Threading Improvements
==================================

- **NUMA-aware work stealing**: a distance-aware scheduling feature
  (:hpx-issue:`7091`), plus fixes for suspended-processing-unit handling
  in NUMA-aware scheduling (:hpx-issue:`6963`) and reduced lock
  contention via randomized victim selection (:hpx-issue:`6904`).
- **Queue performance**: SPSC queue performance work for the
  work-requesting scheduler (:hpx-issue:`7112`), and comparative
  benchmarking / hardening of the MPMC queue (:hpx-issue:`7167`), plus a
  fix for a race condition in ``lockfree::deque::empty()``
  (:hpx-issue:`7158`).
- **Memory/lifetime fixes**: memory accumulating while iterating with a
  sliding semaphore (:hpx-issue:`7185`) and while creating tasks
  (:hpx-issue:`7150`); better lifetime management for background/pool
  threads (:hpx-pr:`7350`); thread-data size reductions
  (:hpx-pr:`7379`); and batched atomic decrements in
  ``thread_queue::cleanup_terminated_locked()`` (:hpx-issue:`7085`).
- **Fork-join executor**: fixed silent truncation for ranges larger than
  2^32 (:hpx-issue:`6922`).

Build / CI Modernization
========================

- A ``CMakePresets.json`` file was added for simplified configuration
  (:hpx-issue:`6798`), along with support for the Ninja Multi-Config
  generator (:hpx-issue:`6710`).
- GitHub Actions workflows were consolidated into composite actions
  (:hpx-issue:`7087`), and a slash-command-driven CI workflow was
  introduced (:hpx-issue:`7075`).
- Dynamic build-and-test discovery replaced some hard-coded exclusion
  lists, though this briefly regressed test coverage on Windows
  (:hpx-issue:`7151`, :hpx-issue:`7199`) before being fixed.
- CircleCI usage was reduced/removed in favor of GitHub Actions.
- Numerous obsolete C++20 feature-test guards were deleted now that C++20
  is the guaranteed baseline (:hpx-issue:`6941`).
- macOS/vcpkg and hidden-visibility build issues were fixed
  (:hpx-issue:`6772`, :hpx-issue:`6653`), and Fedora-specific macro
  collisions (``BLOCK_SIZE``) were resolved (:hpx-issue:`6961`).

Security / Robustness Fixes
===========================

- **Shared-pointer serialization vulnerability**: an insecure
  deserialization / type-confusion issue in shared-pointer serialization
  was fixed (:hpx-issue:`7333`, :hpx-pr:`7334`).
- **Data races**: a race in ``hostname_print_helper::get_hostname()`` on
  worker-thread startup (:hpx-issue:`7520`, :hpx-pr:`7535`,
  :hpx-pr:`7525`, with a regression test added in :hpx-pr:`7546`).
- **Exception safety**: a memory-leak risk in
  ``options_description_easy_init`` under exceptions was fixed
  (:hpx-issue:`7040`), and unsafe ``std::strcat`` usage in ``print.cpp``
  was replaced with safer string operations (:hpx-issue:`7046`).
- **Serialization correctness**: a double-read/type-mismatch bug in
  ``exception_ptr::load()`` was fixed (:hpx-pr:`7278`), along with a
  semantic mismatch in serialization archive flags
  (:hpx-issue:`7034`).

Breaking changes
================

The items below require changes in user code. Each is covered in more detail
in the sections above.

- C++20 is now the minimum required standard. Compiling |hpx| or applications
  using it with C++17 is no longer supported.
- The minimum supported compiler versions have changed. Please see our
  :ref:`prerequisites` page for the current support matrix.
- The use of ``tag_invoke`` for API customization has been removed where
  possible. Code that relied on overloading |hpx| functionality through
  ``tag_invoke`` will have to be adapted.
- Our own, by now outdated, implementation of ``std::execution`` (senders and
  receivers) has been removed. It is replaced by the reference implementation
  (|stdexec|_).
