.. _hpx_2_0_0:

===========================
|hpx| V2.0.0 (Oct 31, 2026)
===========================

|hpx| V2.0.0 is one of the largest releases in the project's history, touching
the language baseline, the execution model, the networking layer, the build
system, and observability tooling. The inventories below cover 697 pull
requests with merge commits in the release comparison, two additional PRs
incorporated through transplanted changes, and 140 closed milestone issues.
The sections below expand on each major theme. Since v1.11.0, about 3000
individual non-merge commits have landed on the way to this release.

Language and Standard Baseline
==============================

- C++20 is now the *minimum* required standard, up from C++17. V1.11.0 was
  the last release to support C++17 (:hpx-issue:`5497`).
- Compared with the 1.11 release branch, the minimum supported GCC
  version rises from 11 to 12, and Visual Studio from 2019 to 2022. The
  minimum Clang version remains 16.
- Base builds require CMake 3.18 or newer. The prerequisite table has been
  corrected to match the enforced minimum; C++20 module builds require a
  newer CMake version as described below.
- A large volume of obsolete ``#if``/feature-test guards that existed only to
  support pre-C++20 compilers were removed (:hpx-issue:`6941`), simplifying
  the codebase now that C++20 is guaranteed.

C++20 Modules
=============

Native C++20 module support was added across the |hpx| module hierarchy
(:hpx-issue:`6014`). It is optional: ``HPX_WITH_CXX_MODULES`` defaults to
``OFF``. Enabling it requires CMake 3.28 or newer, a Ninja or Visual Studio
generator, and GCC 14+, LLVM Clang 16+, or Visual Studio 17.4+. AppleClang
is rejected by the module configuration checks.

C++26 Adoption (Ahead of Standardization)
=========================================

Adopted early via reflection and experimental compiler support:

|hpx| adopted several not-yet-finalized C++26 features early, using
experimental compiler support, well ahead of formal standardization:

- **Reflection-based serialization** - arbitrary user types can now be
  serialized without hand-written ``serialize()`` member functions, using
  compile-time reflection to enumerate members automatically.
- **Reflection-driven actions and components** - a large family of new
  reflection APIs replaced macro-heavy boilerplate:

  - ``reflect_action`` integrated with ``basic_action``
    (:hpx-pr:`7281`), including direct actions (:hpx-pr:`7349`),
    component actions (:hpx-pr:`7311`), and auto-registration
    (:hpx-pr:`7298`).
  - ``reflect_client`` and the ``HPX_REFLECT_CLIENT`` macro for
    reflection-based client types (:hpx-pr:`7385`), with
    ``hpx::launch::sync`` overload support (:hpx-pr:`7417`).
  - ``hpx::async<^^func>(target, ...)``-style reflection overloads
    (:hpx-pr:`7376`), plus reflection overloads threaded through
    ``async_distributed`` (sync, post, dataflow, async_continue,
    launch-policy variants: :hpx-pr:`7509`, :hpx-pr:`7515`,
    :hpx-pr:`7523`, :hpx-pr:`7462`).
  - Example programs migrated to demonstrate the new API:
    ``factorial_reflection`` (:hpx-pr:`7508`), ``fibonacci_reflection``
    (:hpx-pr:`7455`).
  - A migration guide (:hpx-pr:`7348`) and compile-time overhead
    benchmarks comparing macros vs. ``reflect_action``
    (:hpx-pr:`7332`, :hpx-pr:`7459`) were added to help users and
    maintainers evaluate the transition.

- **Early contract support** - |hpx| API functions have begun to be annotated
  with C++26 contract preconditions/postconditions, starting with sorting
  and heap algorithms (:hpx-pr:`7434`).

Senders/Receivers Overhaul
==========================

|hpx|'s original, home-grown implementation of P0443/P1897/P2300
(:hpx-issue:`5045`) has been removed entirely and replaced by |stdexec|_
(|nvidia|_'s reference implementation) as the sole senders/receivers
foundation, usable from both C++20 and C++26:

- Multiple correctness/compliance passes: fixing P2300 compliance and
  ``set_stopped`` handling for ``any_sender`` (:hpx-pr:`7453`),
  ``get_allocator`` query support for schedulers (:hpx-pr:`7320`),
  allocator support for ``when_all_vector`` (:hpx-pr:`7346`), and
  ``get_completion_domain`` advertisement on ``run_loop`` (:hpx-pr:`7276`).
- Distributed and accelerator adaptors were updated to integrate cleanly
  with |stdexec|_: ``async_mpi`` (:hpx-pr:`7341`, :hpx-pr:`7318`,
  :hpx-pr:`7277`), ``async_cuda`` (:hpx-pr:`7330`, :hpx-pr:`7374`), and the
  fork-join executor (fixing truncation bugs on large ranges,
  :hpx-issue:`6922`).
  Distributed sender/receiver facilities were also moved into their own
  module (:hpx-pr:`7396`) with dedicated distributed test coverage
  (:hpx-pr:`7402`, :hpx-pr:`7354`).
- Algorithm-level sender/receiver support was extended to more algorithms,
  e.g. ``set_intersection`` (:hpx-pr:`7365`), ``set_difference``
  (:hpx-pr:`7344`), and ``shift_left``/``shift_right`` (:hpx-pr:`7296`).
- Miscellaneous but important bug fixes: a lifetime race in
  ``sync_wait``'s notify path (:hpx-pr:`7394`), a silent hang in
  ``make_future`` with ``run_loop_scheduler`` (:hpx-pr:`7437`), and a
  future/promise bridge redesign (:hpx-pr:`7355`).

Runtime and Execution APIs
==========================

- The P2079 parallel scheduler integrates sender work with HPX thread pools
  (:hpx-pr:`6655`). ``hpx::execution::experimental::get_parallel_scheduler()``
  uses the default pool; the overload taking a pool reference supports named
  pools obtained through ``hpx::resource::get_thread_pool`` (:hpx-pr:`7579`).
- Execution-policy traits and the independent
  ``rebind_policy_executor_t`` / ``rebind_policy_parameters_t`` utilities
  support inspecting and adapting policies (:hpx-pr:`7550`, :hpx-pr:`7551`).
- Thrust integration adds HPX execution policies for Thrust algorithms in
  CUDA builds (:hpx-pr:`6744`), controlled by ``HPX_WITH_THRUST``.
- New concurrent containers include vector, queue, unordered map, and
  unordered set (:hpx-pr:`6897`).
- ``hpx::local::termination_detection`` waits for local work to finish,
  with timeout, deadline, and stop-token cancellation overloads
  (:hpx-pr:`6886`, :hpx-pr:`6890`).
- ``HPX::init`` supports runtime initialization from libraries, and
  ``HPX::auto_wrap_main`` starts the runtime around ``main()`` without
  requiring the wrapping header (:hpx-pr:`6775`, :hpx-pr:`6804`). The latter
  target is not supported by the native Windows MSVC toolchain.
  Local initialization was decoupled from the distributed runtime
  (:hpx-pr:`7103`).
- ``hpx::threads::set_thread_affinity`` and
  ``hpx::this_thread::set_affinity`` expose thread-affinity control
  (:hpx-pr:`6861`).
- ``finalize`` and ``disconnect`` accept ``std::chrono`` durations through
  new overloads (:hpx-pr:`7612`).
- ``set_rpc_timeout`` now returns ``false`` and leaves the stored timeout
  unchanged when the supplied duration converts to zero milliseconds.
- ``HPX::init`` supports runtime initialization from libraries, and
  ``HPX::auto_wrap_main`` starts the runtime around ``main()`` without
  requiring the wrapping header (:hpx-pr:`6775`, :hpx-pr:`6804`).
  ``HPX::auto_wrap_main`` is also supported with MSVC
  (:hpx-issue:`7662`, :hpx-pr:`7664`).
  Local initialization was decoupled from the distributed runtime
  (:hpx-pr:`7103`).

``tag_invoke`` Removal
======================

A systematic, multi-PR effort removed ``tag_invoke``-based customization
across nearly every layer of the library, replacing it with plain member
functions - this is one of the more consequential breaking changes for
downstream code that customized |hpx| behavior via ADL/``tag_invoke``:

- Core execution layer (:hpx-pr:`7368`), executor CPOs
  (:hpx-pr:`7319`), container algorithms (:hpx-pr:`7395`), and parallel
  algorithms broadly (:hpx-pr:`7380`, :hpx-pr:`7301`).
- Specific customization points converted to members, e.g.
  ``connect_t`` (:hpx-pr:`7292`).
- Cleanup of now-stale ``hpx_tag_invoke`` module dependencies
  (:hpx-pr:`7451`) and a final sweep
  (:hpx-pr:`7443`).

Networking / Parcelport Work
============================

- A new, optimized MPI parcelport, with orderly teardown that quiesces
  before ``MPI_Finalize`` (:hpx-pr:`7404`).
- An optimized |lci|_ parcelport.
- A separate LCW/MPIx parcelport was added (:hpx-pr:`6815`), enabled with
  ``HPX_WITH_PARCELPORT_LCW=ON`` (default ``OFF``).
- Substantial AGAS/parcelset hardening:

  - ``force_disconnect`` support for removing crashed/unreachable
    localities, including races between disconnect completion and AGAS
    resolve visibility (:hpx-issue:`7483`, :hpx-pr:`7490`,
    :hpx-pr:`7491`, :hpx-pr:`7447`).
  - Dijkstra termination detection improvements, including probe retry
    bounding and cursor restart per probe (:hpx-pr:`7496`,
    :hpx-pr:`7516`, :hpx-pr:`7495`).
  - Connection/communicator caching fixes, e.g. avoiding communicator
    reuse between collectives/scan test phases (:hpx-pr:`7526`,
    :hpx-pr:`7364`) and caching channel communicators per site
    (:hpx-pr:`7481`).
  - Disconnected-locality handling, including a dedicated dispatch guard
    (:hpx-pr:`7536`) and correct error handling in
    ``resolve_locality`` (:hpx-pr:`7388`).
  - A fix for the shared-pointer serialization type-confusion /
    deserialization vulnerability reported in :hpx-issue:`7333`
    (:hpx-pr:`7334`).

Observability / Tracing
=======================

- A new, minimal tracing abstraction layer, ``hpx::tracing``
  (:hpx-issue:`7049`), unifying the |ittnotify|_ (Intel VTune) and |tracy|_
  backends behind one API, with |apex|_ also unified under it (:hpx-pr:`7293`).
- |tracy|_ support was added as a first-class profiler backend, including
  causal tracing (:hpx-pr:`7423`), fiber support activation
  (:hpx-issue:`6989`), and per-subsystem event gating for overhead control
  (:hpx-pr:`7529`).
- Instrumentation was added broadly: schedulers and work-stealing
  (:hpx-pr:`7450`), background work and OS-thread sleep events
  (:hpx-pr:`7484`), parcel send/receive (:hpx-pr:`7511`), future
  continuations (:hpx-pr:`7403`), task lifecycle events
  (:hpx-pr:`7347`), suspend/resume hooks (:hpx-pr:`7372`), data-parallel
  workloads (:hpx-pr:`7392`), and general runtime instrumentation
  (:hpx-pr:`7357`).
- LIKWID profiling support was added (:hpx-pr:`6053`), enabled with
  ``HPX_LIKWID_WITH_LIKWID=ON``.
- New tooling built on top of this infrastructure: **hpx-top**, an
  interactive TUI performance monitor (:hpx-issue:`7001`), and
  **hpx_stat_viewer**; both scripts are now installed (:hpx-issue:`7656`,
  :hpx-pr:`7658`).
- A distributed-observability prototype ("HPX-Vision") was proposed and
  discussed (:hpx-issue:`7225`) as a longer-term direction beyond this
  release.
- The |ittnotify|_ tracing backend now provides a shared domain, regions,
  and markers (:hpx-pr:`7636`). The Tracy targets are exported so that
  consumers can find them through HPX (:hpx-pr:`7654`), and Tracy export
  annotations were moved off class heads to build with GCC 11 and 12
  (:hpx-pr:`7669`).

Collectives Infrastructure
==========================

Hierarchical collectives were built out and hardened substantially this
cycle:

- New hierarchical primitives: ``all_reduce`` (with the reduction seed now
  moved instead of copied, :hpx-pr:`7398`), ``all_gather``/``scatter``
  (flattened payloads, :hpx-pr:`7375`), ``all_to_all`` (flattened
  exchange payloads :hpx-pr:`7377`, hierarchical implementation
  :hpx-pr:`7307`, size-based pairwise dispatch :hpx-pr:`7431`,
  and a ~66x performance regression fix for the flat variant,
  :hpx-issue:`7411`), and a hierarchical **scan** collective
  (:hpx-pr:`7343`).
- Validation and robustness hardening across collectives, including
  rejecting explicit generations mixed with auto-generation
  (:hpx-pr:`7369`), unifying generation handling across collective types
  (:hpx-pr:`7326`), and broad input-validation/tree-coverage hardening
  (:hpx-pr:`7321`, :hpx-pr:`7359`).
- ``hpx::distributed::barrier`` was reimplemented on top of the
  collectives infrastructure rather than its own ad hoc protocol
  (:hpx-issue:`7203`).

Supervision Module
==================

A new lifecycle/observability subsystem, "supervision," was introduced for
managing dispatch of distributed work under crash/partial-failure
conditions:

- Core infrastructure for lifecycle events and observers
  (:hpx-pr:`7399`), a dispatch component (:hpx-pr:`7413`), and
  admission control (:hpx-pr:`7409`).
- Fenced dispatch support (:hpx-pr:`7425`), dispatch locality and join
  epoch handling (:hpx-pr:`7438`), and target resolution
  (:hpx-pr:`7427`), plus general dispatch fixes and cleanup
  (:hpx-pr:`7457`).
- A reflection overload for ``dispatch_work`` was added consistent with
  the broader C++26 reflection push (:hpx-pr:`7432`).
- The module can be disabled at build time (``HPX_WITH_SUPERVISION=OFF``);
  a related abort-on-disable regression was fixed
  (:hpx-issue:`7513`).

Parallel Algorithms
===================

A large, ongoing wave of standard-conformance and correctness work across
the parallel algorithms library:

- **C++20/23 conformance**: fixing sentinel return-type mismatches in
  ``hpx::ranges`` container CPOs (:hpx-pr:`7322`), unifying projection
  support across ``starts_with``/``ends_with`` (:hpx-pr:`7314`),
  and adding projection coverage for ``unique``/``unique_copy``
  (:hpx-pr:`7393`) and ``minmax_element`` (:hpx-pr:`7230`).
- **New algorithms**: ``hpx::experimental::for_each_index`` per P4150
  (:hpx-issue:`7214`), ``hpx::ranges::iota`` (:hpx-issue:`6969`),
  ``find_last``/``find_last_if``/``find_last_if_not``
  (:hpx-issue:`6892`), and the C++23 fold family: ``fold_left``,
  ``fold_right``, ``fold_left_first``, ``fold_right_last``,
  ``fold_left_with_iter``, and ``fold_left_first_with_iter``
  (:hpx-pr:`6884`, :hpx-pr:`6910`).
- **Correctness fixes**: ``max_element`` returning the last, rather than
  first, greatest element (:hpx-pr:`7304`), two bugs in ``chunk_size.hpp``
  involving swapped arguments (:hpx-issue:`6931`), an incorrect
  single-segment subrange handling bug in segmented ``scan``
  (:hpx-issue:`7052`), and non-preserved sequenced semantics in parallel
  ``uninitialized_relocate`` for overlapping ranges (:hpx-issue:`6878`).
- **Proxy/iterator support**: proxy support for ``find`` algorithms
  (:hpx-issue:`6719`), unwrapping contiguous iterators
  (:hpx-issue:`6729`), and conditional special member functions for
  ``zip_iterator`` (:hpx-issue:`6752`).
- **Datapar/SIMD**: fixing |eve|_/simd unaligned load/store broadcast bugs
  (:hpx-pr:`7435`, :hpx-issue:`7287`), and guarding a mismatched SIMD
  path on ``zip_iterator`` compatibility (:hpx-pr:`7328`).

Scheduler / Threading Improvements
==================================

- **NUMA-aware work stealing**: a distance-aware scheduling feature
  (:hpx-issue:`7091`), plus fixes for suspended-processing-unit handling
  in NUMA-aware scheduling (:hpx-issue:`6963`) and reduced lock
  contention via randomized victim selection (:hpx-issue:`6904`).
- **Queue performance**: SPSC queue performance work for the
  work-requesting scheduler (:hpx-issue:`7112`), and comparative
  benchmarking / hardening of the MPMC queue (:hpx-issue:`7167`), plus a
  fix for a race condition in ``lockfree::deque::empty()``
  (:hpx-issue:`7158`).
- **Memory/lifetime fixes**: memory accumulating while iterating with a
  sliding semaphore (:hpx-issue:`7185`) and while creating tasks
  (:hpx-issue:`7150`); better lifetime management for background/pool
  threads (:hpx-pr:`7350`); thread-data size reductions
  (:hpx-pr:`7379`); and batched atomic decrements in
  ``thread_queue::cleanup_terminated_locked()`` (:hpx-issue:`7085`).
- **Fork-join executor**: fixed silent truncation for ranges larger than
  2^32 (:hpx-issue:`6922`).
- **Shared priority scheduler**: the scheduler now creates a new thread
  when one is requested (:hpx-issue:`5189`, :hpx-pr:`7682`).

Build / CI Modernization
========================

- A ``CMakePresets.json`` file was added for simplified configuration
  (:hpx-issue:`6798`), along with support for the Ninja Multi-Config
  generator (:hpx-issue:`6710`).
- GitHub Actions workflows were consolidated into composite actions
  (:hpx-issue:`7087`), and a slash-command-driven CI workflow was
  introduced (:hpx-issue:`7075`).
- Dynamic build-and-test discovery replaced some hard-coded exclusion
  lists, though this briefly regressed test coverage on Windows
  (:hpx-issue:`7151`, :hpx-issue:`7199`) before being fixed.
- CircleCI usage was reduced/removed in favor of GitHub Actions.
- Numerous obsolete C++20 feature-test guards were deleted now that C++20
  is the guaranteed baseline (:hpx-issue:`6941`).
- macOS/vcpkg and hidden-visibility build issues were fixed
  (:hpx-issue:`6772`, :hpx-issue:`6653`), and Fedora-specific macro
  collisions (``BLOCK_SIZE``) were resolved (:hpx-issue:`6961`).
- Conan builds now alias lowercase targets for Asio and Hwloc
  (:hpx-issue:`7659`, :hpx-pr:`7661`).
- MSVC and MinGW fixes: ``dbghelp.lib`` is named from ``backtrace.cpp``
  (:hpx-pr:`7665`), and the static empty vtable fallback in
  ``execution_base`` is used on Windows builds
  (:hpx-issue:`7650`, :hpx-pr:`7652`). The raw MSVC ``hpx_main`` path of
  ``godbolt-minimal`` is now CI-tested and documented, and passes
  ``/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE`` (:hpx-pr:`7644`, :hpx-pr:`7683`).
- A Linux CI workflow with ``_GLIBCXX_DEBUG`` enabled was added
  (:hpx-pr:`7673`), and the parallel scheduler tests were fixed on
  Clang 16 (:hpx-pr:`7679`).

Security / Robustness Fixes
===========================

- **Shared-pointer serialization vulnerability**: an insecure
  deserialization / type-confusion issue in shared-pointer serialization
  was fixed (:hpx-issue:`7333`, :hpx-pr:`7334`).
- **Data races**: a race in ``hostname_print_helper::get_hostname()`` on
  worker-thread startup (:hpx-issue:`7520`, :hpx-pr:`7525`, with a regression
  test added in :hpx-pr:`7546`).
- **Synchronization**: corrected timed semaphore waits (:hpx-pr:`7617`),
  a deadlock and race in ``latch::reset`` (:hpx-pr:`7555`),
  and handling of spurious wakeups in ``hpx::barrier`` (:hpx-pr:`7611`).
  The memory order used after a condition-variable wakeup in future
  ``wait()`` was upgraded from relaxed to acquire (:hpx-pr:`7677`).
- **AGAS garbage collection**: fixed background collection when networking
  is disabled (:hpx-pr:`7627`).
- **Exception safety**: a memory-leak risk in
  ``options_description_easy_init`` under exceptions was fixed
  (:hpx-issue:`7040`), and unsafe ``std::strcat`` usage in ``print.cpp``
  was replaced with safer string operations (:hpx-issue:`7046`).
- **Serialization correctness**: a double-read/type-mismatch bug in
  ``exception_ptr::load()`` was fixed (:hpx-pr:`7278`), along with a
  semantic mismatch in serialization archive flags
  (:hpx-issue:`7034`). Collection sizes read from archives are now checked
  before use (:hpx-pr:`7594`).

Breaking changes
================

The items below require changes in user code. Each is covered in more detail
in the sections above.

- C++20 is now the minimum required standard. Compiling |hpx| or applications
  using it with C++17 is no longer supported.
- The minimum supported compiler versions have changed. Please see our
  :ref:`prerequisites` page for the current support matrix.
- The use of ``tag_invoke`` for API customization has been removed where
  possible. Code that relied on overloading |hpx| functionality through
  ``tag_invoke`` will have to be adapted.
- Our own, by now outdated, implementation of ``std::execution`` (senders and
  receivers) has been removed. It is replaced by the reference implementation
  (|stdexec|_).

Closed Issues and Pull Requests
==================================

The lists below were reconciled against release-2.0.X at
``f9ff18393361421aaf4a1105a7c8dba0bbad0f8a``, using release-1.11.X at
``4823cb5b41cc6ec5ab3a49741541927f24704bf3`` as the baseline (including its
maintenance backports, rather than only the v1.11.0 tag).

There are 697 merged PRs whose merge commits are reachable from the release
and absent from that baseline, including PRs outside milestone 2.0.0. The
140 closed issues are the milestone inventory; closure does not necessarily
mean an implementation was delivered. Closed, unmerged PRs are excluded.
Two further PRs with verified transplanted changes are recorded separately
below the generated list.
